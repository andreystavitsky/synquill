## 🎯 Key Concepts

Before diving into the documentation, familiarize yourself with these core concepts:

- **Offline-First**: Synquill prioritizes local operations, syncing with remote APIs when connectivity allows
- **Model-Driven**: Define your data models once, generate repositories, DAOs, and database tables automatically
- **Queue-Based Sync**: Smart sync queues handle dependencies between related data operations
- **Reactive Streams**: Real-time UI updates through `Stream<T>` APIs that respond to data changes
- **Configurable Policies**: Control when and how data is loaded and saved with flexible policies

## 🔧 Common Use Cases

| Use Case | Recommended Reading |
|----------|-------------------|
| Getting started with Synquill | [Quick Start Guide](guide.md) |
| Setting up API communication | [API Adapters](api-adapters.md) |
| Configuring background sync | [Configuration](configuration.md) |
| Optimizing database performance | [Advanced Features](advanced-features.md) |
| Managing complex sync scenarios | [Queue Management](advanced/queues.md) |
| Handling related data dependencies | [Dependency Resolution](advanced/dependency-resolver.md) |
| Looking up specific methods | [API Reference](api-reference.md) |

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic CRUD operations before implementing complex sync scenarios
2. **Test Offline**: Always test your app's behavior when connectivity is unavailable
3. **Monitor Queues**: Use the queue monitoring tools to debug sync issues
4. **Optimize Queries**: Leverage indexes and efficient query patterns for better performance
5. **Handle Errors**: Implement proper error handling for network and database operations
